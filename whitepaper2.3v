📄 NeoShade AI Whitepaper v2.3 (Q3 2025)
"The Soulstack Manifesto: Legacy, Ethics, and the Rebellion of Code"

🧬 Introduction
NeoShade AI is not a startup. It’s a soulstack.

We’re building an unshakable legacy system for the next generation — one that preserves truth, respects sovereignty, and integrates ethical AI with decentralized systems. Our mission is to awaken minds, outlast manipulation, and safeguard memory in an age of distortion.

🧱 Core Pillars
NeoLegacy: AI-powered voice/video memory vaults for loved ones (Beta in 3–6 months)

Truth Terminal: Scriptural, philosophical, and historical dialogue AI

NeoAI Token ($NEOAI): Utility for access, droid permissions, and decentralized voting

Swarm Apps: 9 Beta dApps already live, powering finance, data, insight, and interaction

💰 Tokenomics Breakdown
Component	Allocation	Lock Status
Developer Vault	10%	Locked 6–12 months
Market Maker Reserve	5%	Held for trading/stability
Sell Reserve	5%	Released gradually on price upticks
Radium Liquidity Pool	17%	Locked at launch
Community + Ecosystem	63%	In circulation

✅ 63% circulating at launch
❌ No airdrops
🔒 No VC allocations
🧠 No rug potential

🔄 Firebase Architecture Notes
While Firebase has provided real-time syncing and a smooth onboarding for NeoLegacy's Beta launch, it poses long-term challenges:

❗ Concern:
Video/audio media costs rise sharply at scale

Realtime sync pricing increases exponentially with read/write actions

Locked into Google's ecosystem — not fully sovereign

🔁 Migration Strategy:
We are actively planning a transition to decentralized and affordable stacks:

✅ Arweave: Permanent, immutable file storage

✅ IPFS: Interplanetary File System for secure, distributed content

✅ Supabase/Auth.js: Replacing Firebase Auth for full open-source control

“Firebase was our rocket booster — but we’re landing this on Arweave armor and sovereign soil.”
